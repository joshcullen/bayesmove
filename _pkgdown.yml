    desc: >
      These vignettes provide an example workflow of estimating segment-level behavioral
      states by discretizing data streams, partitioning tracks into segments, and
      clustering segments into states.

      This vignettes provides an example workflow to estimate observation-level behavioral
      states by discretizing data streams and then clustering segments into states directly.
