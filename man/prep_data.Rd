\title{Calculate step lengths, turning angles, and time steps}
\usage{
prep_data(dat, coord.names, id)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame that contains a column for animal IDs, the columns
associated with the x and y coordinates, and a column for the date. For
easier interpretation of the model results, it is recommended that
coordinates be stored after UTM projection (meters) as opposed to
unprojected in decimal degrees (map units). Date-time should be of class
\code{POSIXct} and be labeled \code{date} within the data frame.}

\item{coord.names}{character. A vector of the column names under which the
coordinates are stored. The name for the x coordinate should be listed
first and the name for the y coordinate second.}

\item{id}{character. The name of the column storing the animal IDs.}
}
\value{
A data frame where all original data are returned and new columns are
  added for step length (\code{step}), turning angle (\code{angle}), and time
  step (\code{dt}). Names for coordinates are changed to \code{x} and
  \code{y}. Units for step length depend on the projection of the
  coordinates, turning angles are returned in radians, and time steps are
  returned in seconds.
}
\description{
Calculates step lengths and turning angles based on coordinates for each
animal ID and calculates time steps based on the date-time. Provides a
self-contained method to calculate these variables without needing to rely on
other R packages (e.g., \code{adehabitatLT}). However, functions from other
packages can also be used to perform this step in data preparation.

\examples{
#load data
data(tracks)

#subset only first track
tracks<- tracks[tracks$id == "id1",]

#calculate step lengths and turning angles
tracks<- prep_data(dat = tracks, coord.names = c("x","y"), id = "id")

}
