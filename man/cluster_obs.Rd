\title{Cluster observations into behavioral states}
\usage{
cluster_obs(dat, alpha, ngibbs, nmaxclust, nburn)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame that only contains columns for the animal IDs as well
as each of the discretized movement variables.}

\item{alpha}{numeric. A single value used to specify the hyperparameter for
the prior distribution.}

\item{ngibbs}{numeric. The total number of iterations of the MCMC chain.}

\item{nmaxclust}{numeric. A single number indicating the maximum number of
clusters to test.}

\item{nburn}{numeric. The length of the burn-in phase.}
}
\value{
A list of model results is returned where elements include the
  \code{phi} matrix for each data stream, \code{theta} matrix, log likelihood
  estimates for each iteration of the MCMC chain \code{loglikel}, a list of
  the latent cluster estimates for each observation \code{z}, and a vector
  \code{gamma1} of estimates for the gamma hyperparameter.
}
\description{
This function performs a Gibbs sampler within a mixture model to estimate the
optimal number of behavioral states, the state-dependent distributions, and
to assign behavioral states to each observation. This model does not assume
an underlying mechanistic process.
}
\details{
The mixture model analyzes all animal IDs pooled together, thus providing
population-level estimates of behavioral states.
