\title{Round time to nearest interval}
\usage{
round_track_time(dat, id, dt, date, int, tol, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame that contains the sampling interval of the
observations.}

\item{id}{character. The name of the column storing the animal IDs.}

\item{dt}{character. The name of the column storing the time intervals.}

\item{date}{character. The name of the column storing the dates that are of
class \code{POSIXct}.}

\item{int}{numeric. A vector of the time interval(s) of on which to perform
rounding.}

\item{tol}{numeric. A single tolerance value on which to round any \code{int}
that were specified.}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
A data frame where \code{dt} and \code{date} are both adjusted based
  upon the rounding of time intervals according to the specified tolerance.
}
\description{
Rounds sampling intervals that are close, but not exactly the time interval
of interest (e.g., 240 s instead of 300 s). This can be performed on multiple
time intervals, but only using a single tolerance value. This function
prepares the data to be analyzed by \code{\link{segment_behavior}}, which
requires that all time intervals exactly match the primary time interval when
analyzing step lengths and turning angles.
}
\examples{
#simulate data
step<- rgamma(1000, c(1, 2.5, 10), c(1, 1, 1))
angle<- runif(1000, -pi, pi)
date<- seq(c(ISOdate(2020, 6, 17, tz = "UTC")), by = "hour", length.out = 1000)
date<- date + lubridate::seconds(runif(length(date), -15, 15))  #introduce noise
dt<- as.numeric(diff(date)) * 60  #convert time difference to seconds
dt<- c(dt, NA)
id<- rep(1:10, each = 100)

#create data frame
dat<- data.frame(id, date, dt, step, angle)

#run function
dat1<- round_track_time(dat = dat, id = "id", date = "date", dt = "dt",
                        int = 3600, tol = 20)
