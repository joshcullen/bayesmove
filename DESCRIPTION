Description: Methods for assessing animal movement from telemetry and biologging
    data using non-parametric Bayesian methods. This includes features for pre-
    processing and analysis of data, as well as the visualization of results
    from the models. This framework does not rely on standard parametric density
    functions, which provides flexibility during model fitting.
