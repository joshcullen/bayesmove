  New submission

  Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

    pre (10:76)
  
  This is my first submission of the 'bayesmove' package to CRAN. Both 'biologging' and 'prep' are spelled correctly within the Description section of the DESCRIPTION file. The words 'biologging' and 'pre' are also saved within WORDLIST.
